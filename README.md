To run your GitHub project (`Stawberry-chat-ai`) on a VNC server using Termux, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Install and Set Up VNC Server in Termux**
1. **Update Termux and Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   pkg install tigervnc git python
   ```
2. **Install a Desktop Environment (e.g., XFCE)**:
   Install XFCE for a lightweight desktop environment:
   ```bash
   pkg install xfce4
   ```

3. **Start the VNC Server**:
   Initialize the VNC server and set a password:
   ```bash
   vncserver
   ```
   You will be prompted to set a password for accessing the VNC session. Note the display number (e.g., `:1`).

4. **Start the VNC Server Session**:
   To start the desktop session:
   ```bash
   vncserver :1
   ```

---

### **2. Clone the GitHub Project**
1. Clone your GitHub project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wwwstawberrycom/Stawberry-chat-ai.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Stawberry-chat-ai
   ```

---

### **3. Install Dependencies**
1. Ensure `pip` is installed and up to date:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries for your project (if a `requirements.txt` file is present):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### **4. Run the Project**
1. Start the Python script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Replace `app.py` with the main script file of your project.

2. If the project has a web interface, use a browser in the VNC session to access it. For example:
   - Open a web browser in the VNC session and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

### **5. Connect to VNC Server**
1. Install a VNC viewer on your device (e.g., **VNC Viewer**, available on Google Play Store).
2. Connect to the VNC server using the address:
   ```
   127.0.0.1:5901
   ```
   Replace `5901` with `590X`, where `X` is the display number of your VNC session.

---

### **6. Troubleshooting**
- If the project fails to run, ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible.
- For UI issues, confirm that XFCE or your chosen desktop environment is running correctly.
- Check logs or error messages to debug.

Let me know if you encounter any issues during the setup!
